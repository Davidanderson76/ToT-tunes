TOT TUNES

Have you ever had a song stuck in your head all day and you just CAN'T think of the name of the song? Or who even sings it??
Also referred to as Tip Of Tongue syndrome.
It's a terrible feeling.


ToT-Tunes is a musical artist search that allows you to input any lyrical content you may know or be able to recall, and will 
display results of artists who use those lyrics in their tunes. 
ToT-Tunes was created for the people to help escape that horrid feeling of being unaware of the song that is stuck in your head.

FEATURES:
ToT-Tunes has two features currently with many ideas brewing on the way to be added.
First off there is the ToT-Tunes search bar which is ready to take in any users searched lyrics and present them with results of artists 
who use the specified lyrics input.

Sometimes you get bored of the same old songs and playlists, which brings us to the second feature that ToT-Tunes has to offer, the "Spudify" 
button. The "Spudify" feature allows the user to click on a fun button and have a random song pop up that they
can then enjoy as they please.
